<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to need a better answer than that, Joan,” my doctor told
me, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s an odd request but… I just feel that… as glad as I am
to be rid of it… well, I’d still like to hang on to it,” I tried to explain,
touching my heel to the bootstrap of my shoe, since manners didn’t permit
knocking on wood—let alone this guys head.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t exactly answer my question,” he exclaimed, resting
his chin in his cupped hand. “I don’t suppose there’s any real problem with
it. But...”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know… it’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p>“Then what is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s… well, this is gonna sound kind of stupid but… it’s a part of my
past—and it was a part of me… I just want it… kinda like a scrapbook,” I
said, crawling through my words.</p>
<p>He gave a low-browed pose for his reflection in the window before
turning to address me. I swallowed my anxiety and sat up straight for the
verdict. His eyes dabbled on the side of judgmental. He looked me up and
down while his fingers tapped on his desk, leaving a pronounced thump that
echoed in my skull. I pulled out of mind to embody his, no doubt, shady
opinion of me. The kind of self deprecating reflection inherent to eating
disorders, Catholics, or people who request ‘amputated body parts they
endeavored to escape.’ But before I could get into it…</p>
<p>“Alright… you can have it,” he sighed, likely having grown bored
with my presence.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Doc.”</p>
<p>“So… how do you plan on… transporting it?”</p>
<p>“Gotcha covered,” I gleamed, turning to the side and reaching for
my faded pink, cargo bag. I unbuckled the bag and fished around its innards
of crumpled paper until I felt something solid. The dusty glass pickle jar I’d
packed into my bag was blanketed in an old, ripped up, magazine. I brushed
aside the final sheets from the jar and tossed them aside—catching eye of a
dazed model, posing by streetlight.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant,” he mumbled, as I slid the pickle jar halfway
across his desk.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t referring so much to the vessel of transport as I was to the
means of transportation,” he explained, tentatively pulling the jar towards
him. He made a huffing sound and gave me a frustrated look. He hadn’t seen
my bag. “I would think overtly carrying a penis in a pickle jar would get you
the wrong kind of attention.”</p>
<p>“Not compared to cutting it off in the first place,” I laughed, dotting
the i…</p>
<p><span>Chapter 1</span></p>
<p>The streetlight was always the focal point. I woke up missing my
alarm clock two or three times, striking the table instead, and smelled the
damp of my room. Everything was dark, quiet and still. The floor wasn’t
there or, that’s to say it could hardly be seen under the clothes piled atop it.
The posters of screaming musicians, whose names I’d forgotten the day after
I purchased them, watched over me. They were peeling and, unfortunately,
let my bright orange wallpaper shine through. This ghastly decorative feature
was complemented by the bare wires poking out of vacant electrical sockets,
missing doorknob, and the cigarette charred hole in my wall. I sat on an old
mattress that I had managed to salvage from the street corner. It shone of
yellow stains that originated from either urine or coffee. Neither managed to
dent the high nasal reek of vomit, creeping in from my bathroom. To my
right was my disposal area, which consisted of a garbage bag duct-taped to
the wall. To my left was the window, illuminated by the solo streetlight,
which saved me the trouble of paying my electrical bills most months. And
right in front of me were the double-gold doors of my closet, shadowing the
dark green door providing entrance to this hell.</p>
<p>“How did I get here?” I groggily asked myself, slowly peeling my
pasty lips apart. I stretched my arms and legs, letting out a loud yawn and
slight squeal.</p>
<p>I kicked around a little, until the sheets were at my waist. I leaned
against the wall, resting my head on Gene Simmon’s long black and white
tongue. My ass sank into the mattress and I felt an M&M crush beneath it. As
poster-Gene ate out my scalp, I reflected for a moment on my current
situation. I thought of last night (or that I knew last night had occurred) and
hoped thinking would restore my memory. But I gave up on that when a
misplaced hooker walked past my window. Then I focused on what I could
do in the middle of the night with no money, but forgot what I’d been
thinking once more when a rustling came from outside my door. I lowered
my head and bit my lip, frantically checking around my bed for a used
condom in case I had fucked someone the night before. Nothing. A moaning
floorboard drew my focus and I scowled sharply, staring at the hole in my
door reserved for a lost knob. I watched as something moved past the
opening. My heart raced and I let out a shrill cry with my voice cracking in
the middle. Then, like the sound of a stampede, the hole was filled with the
figure of an unknown charging full throttle towards my ugly green door. I
said a little prayer against a burglar, rapist, or Jehovah’s Witness. I either
held my breath or couldn’t breathe, as a loud thud came from my door
slamming open. And even amidst all of my flinching bravery I couldn’t help
but cry out, ‘Take what you want and leave me alone!’</p>
<p>“Excuse me? And exactly what would I take?” A high pitched voice
exclaimed. I cracked my eyes open to see a man standing with his hands on
his hips, glaring at me. His rock-and-roll, light denim, worn jeans—with the
benefit of cuts on the knees and ass—gave me hope. A long-sleeve, violet, vneck,
100% cotton shirt, with a Power Puff girl holding up her dress, gave
me pleasure. And when my eyes were finally open enough to come to a
conclusion, relief was the verdict.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Lillie! You scared the shit out of me!” I yelled,
slamming my hands on my mattress. He stood motionless, curling up the top
of his mouth until his face reflected the very definition of disgust. I had to
have done something wrong, and ‘what?’ was what I had to find out.</p>
<p>“It’s bad enough that I had to stay in this shit hole over night because
of you! But now you’re screaming at me? Well I don’t need this crap.” Lillie
bitched, as he shifted his weight from his right side to his left. His arms were
now off of his hips and his hands fully extended making gestures while he
talked. As his right hand glided up and shook its way back down to his hip, I
recalled his show—immediately thinking of dark blue eye shadow and fish
net stockings. I shook my head a bit, trying to dismiss my thoughts and pay
attention, but Lillie was too angry to be coherent and following him was a
dead end.</p>
<p>“Like I’m some kind of fucking servant!” he yelled, continuing on
with how infuriated he was, leaving me uninformed on the happenings of the
night prior. My head stopped as I stared off into space, trying to remember
why he was in my apartment. However, in my doing so, he took it as though
I were blowing him off and began to storm out of my bedroom.</p>
<p>“Wait! Why did you have to stay here over night?” I asked, with just
enough desperation in my voice to make him stop and turn towards me again.
He lifted his hand until it was next to his face and looked at the floor shaking
his index finger back and forth.</p>
<p>“Do not tell me that you don’t remember last night!”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember last night,” I said hesitantly, squinting and
waiting for the fur to fly upon his outraged response. His jaw dropped and he
stared at me bug eyed for a moment. He made a few attempts to speak, but
only varying degrees of murmurs came out.</p>
<p>“God, you are so pathetic!” he squealed, now enjoying my absent
memory and ignorance of whatever stupid thing I should have known I’d
done. “Well good luck with that!” he stated, turning once more to leave, only
to stop upon my dire request for him to stay.</p>
<p>“Come on Lillie, please! What happened last night?” I cried,
slumping my shoulders and pouting. I kept my head down but looked up at
his now glowing smile.</p>
<p>“Why exactly should I tell you what happened?” he asked, toying
with my curiosity.</p>
<p>“So I can begin to understand just how much I owe you,” I whined,
puckering up; not to kiss ass but to lick hole. His smile lessened and turned
into more of a smirk. He took his weight off of his leg and stood upright
folding his arms across his chest.</p>
<p>“Now that’s a good reason,” he said, gesturing for me to get up and
follow him by quickly tilting his head back and to the side. I wobbled to my
feet and stepped on my sheet a few times over, tumbling forward into a large
heap of clothes. I cursed face down into them, releasing only vaguely
recognizable dogmatic damnations directed at circumstance and my clumsy
act. After a moments hesitation I sucked in a breath of air, festering with my
dirty laundry’s potent repugnance, and flipped to my side like a groggy
walrus. Lillie watched me wearily, growing more and more impatient since I
hadn’t showed him the proper respect. After a few seconds he walked
forward and gracefully extending one of his long legs to kick me in the
shoulder. I swatted lazily at him, and sat up out of principal-fury.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” I remarked, rubbing my shoulder that didn’t really
hurt.</p>
<p>“Incase I hadn’t made it clear earlier, hanging out in this flee pit isn’t
putting me in a better mood. So I suggest that we get to getting things settled
so I can get the hell out of here,” Lillie whispered/hissed, knowing that
resorting to violence only worked so much as to get my attention. I
whimpered grudgingly at first, but when my nose caught coffee in the air my
motivation became clear. I quickly rose to my feet, ready to follow Lillie
wherever he wanted to take me.</p>
<p>I watched Lillie’s tall lanky figure stride forward, with his arms
positioned at his sides in a perma-feminine stance. He wiggled his hips that
contained about as much fat as a runway model fresh out of the john. He
turned to the side to check if I were still following him and I could feel his
indignation shoot off his sharp cheekbones, keeping me on edge. His dark,
short hair, (blotched in places from ruff-sex-tugging-escapades) was matted
down on one side from sleeping on my couch. He looked a mess, which
would undoubtedly mean I’d be subject to more than his typical ‘mad at me’
mood.</p>
<p>“Are you making coffee?” I asked, while wrapping my sheet around
me to keep my ass from getting cold. He ignored my comment at first as he
walked over to the counter, thrusting his chest up and clenching his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought you’d need it after last nights escapades, but your
alcohol tolerance has wowed me once again,” he exclaimed, fiddling with a
kettle that he had resting on my dormant stovetop.</p>
<p>“How did you get any hot water? Everything I’ve got to heat it is
broken,” I said, sitting down on one of three chairs surrounding an old lime
green kitchen table. Lillie pulled out two plastic cups from a bag that I had
on top of my broken-down, pink, spray-painted, fridge.</p>
<p>“It’s not hot, just warm,” he said, looking back at me while plopping
two instant coffee bags into the cups and chasing them with more coffee.
“Your sink’s not working in here and there’s no way in hell I’d go into your
bathroom! So I had to go down to the Chinese restaurant across the street and
buy some egg roles to use their washroom,” he explained, crumpling up an
old cup that he had used for coffee at some point earlier on. “By the way
there are still a few rolls left if you want them... I think they’re diseased or
something,”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said, pulling them towards me as Lillie swung around
from the counter and dropped into a chair, handing me my drink as he did so.
I lifted it to my mouth and took a sip. I slammed my eyes shut and thought of
chocolate to keep the gag reflex from kicking in, but after the initial blow I
let my bitter face fade to a scowl.</p>
<p>“If you’re too good for it, I’ll drink it,” Lillie remarked, clearly
resenting my high standards for night-after-refreshments.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I appreciate everything you’ve done, but it tastes like
something died in this,” I said, sloshing around my coffee, as I stared into its
gooey black depth.</p>
<p>“So what’s the last thing you remember happening last night?”</p>
<p>I paused for a moment scanning my memory, trying to find the
rewind button. I got a flash of Lillie holding my hair back while I puked my
guts out into my bathtub. I saw us getting passed by cab after cab, and Lillie
yelling at each of them while they screeched away. A flash of a club, but I
wasn’t sure which one. Another club came up, but I didn’t know if it was the
same one or not. Then I remembered us sitting on my torn-to-shit, plaid
couch drinking coolers. The gurgling that defined every word I could recall,
morphed to clear and distinguished words. ‘We’re running out of people to
discriminate against; pretty soon we’re gonna have to admit we don’t have a
reason for hating each other,’ I remembered hearing Dawn, the biggest bitch
in all the land, complain.</p>
<p>“We were all sitting around here drinking, and Dawn was talking
about prejudicial-fads,” I finally replied, after much hesitation and thought.
Lillie laughed and took another sip of his coffee—throwing in a little
‘commercial enjoyment of his beverage,’ before continuing to demean me.</p>
<p>“You know that was over a day ago?” he exclaimed, giving me a
sympathetic (for the sake of superiority) look that made me feel even more
pathetic.</p>
<p>“Fine, so what happened after that?” I said in a huff, trying to get the
whole ‘memory loss’ thing out of mind.</p>
<p>“Before we get to that,” Lillie stated, pulling back his anger just
enough to show how concerned he really was. “Are you ok?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine… a little hung over, but…”</p>
<p>“No, not today… lately you’ve been acting like...”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Look, I know how hard its been for you since she left you… since
the robbery and the funeral, but… what you’re doing to yourself isn’t ok.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” I stated, shooting him a cold glare so he’d stop tickling
the skeletons in my closet.</p>
<p>“Fine,” he snapped, returning to anger. “Anyway, back to last
night… Since we were celebrating April’s promotion, we went where she
wanted. But, as always, we got split up on the dance floor. After like an hour
or so, we managed to re-group but Dawn found his fuck buddy for the night
and ditched.”</p>
<p>“He can be such an asshole,” I grumbled, reaching quarter-cup-gone
zone on my coffee.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he sure can be,” Lillie stated in an unimpressed tone. He
adjusted his seat and uncrossed his legs so that he could turn to look at me
head-on for the upcoming onslaught. “Well somehow in the midst of all the
confusion you had run into your old friend, Joe. You remember Joe, right?
The one I forbid you to converse with, the cost being our friendship?” he
said, lowering his brows, head, voice and my feeling of self-worth.</p>
<p>“Yeah... I remember Joe,” I replied, gulping down some of the putrid
goop coffee that I had left in my mouth.</p>
<p>I noted past mistakes, supposed resolve and inevitable regress as
Lillie continued to lecture/inform me. He was with out a doubt more upset
than he had ever been with me. But, anger I could handle—it was his pity
that scared me.</p>
<p>“So, if you remember Joe, then of course you remember what he
does?” he half asked, half snapped at me.</p>
<p>“Uh huh,” I said, nodding, while sinking down into my chair cushion
that deflated and made a noise like a muffled fart.</p>
<p>“And you’ll never guess what the two of you did while you were
talking,” Lillie exclaimed, becoming noticeably more tense. He watched me
squint, smile, and then whimper, “Sorry.” “Anyway,” he continued. “by the
time we found you, you’d done enough lines to draw a white picket fence.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t OD did I?” I asked, appreciating my coffee, as a sudden
zest for life hit me and I thought how things could be so much worse.</p>
<p>“No, you didn’t OD,” Lillie replied, positively pissed and losing his
Queen-like charm. “You did however perk up quite a bit... April decided that
you were ok to come along with us to another club, seeing as how she was
having trouble getting laid where we were. I however was—scratch that am
furious with you. But I didn’t want to ruin April’s big night by killing you, so
we all grabbed a cab and sped away to a dike bar,” he muttered, taking a
brief moment to chomp onto one of the egg rolls. “You were deep-fried for
the whole ride and were looking at all the pretty lights pass by. I was biting
my tongue to keep from screaming and April was fantasizing about whatever
cheap trick she’d be hooking up with for the night,” he explained, making the
obligatory eating while trying to talk noises. I waited patiently, covered by
my puffed-up-white-sheet-tuck-job, complemented by the egg roll crumbs
and diarrhea coffee. Lillie swallowed hard before resuming his eccentrically
detailed storytelling and I relaxed as he finally appeared to loosen up.</p>
<p>“Which bar did we go to?” I asked, forgetting that I was walking on
eggshells.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, and stop interrupting me!” he yelled, shutting me
up. “We arrived and I locked arms with you to keep you from finding another
candy store. April sat down at the bar and tried to fend off all of the people
hitting on her. You even got a few nibbles yourself, but I managed to keep
them away,” he said, pausing momentarily to see whether or not I was going
to object to his actions and interrupt once more. I stayed still, watching him
glare at me before he hesitantly continued his story. “So, April found the lust
of her life and departed from the group, leaving us with the task of finding a
way home. I went outside and tried to get a cab, but somehow you managed
to grab a hold of a few more Margaritas when I wasn’t looking; I think you
swiped them from other people at the bar, but I’m not sure,” he muttered,
trying to logically explain my means of inebriating myself behind his back.
“So after I’d half-bitten off my tongue, and my eyes rolled back in my head
far enough to unplug themselves, I managed to get you to sit down outside.”</p>
<p>“Wait! I remember this part,” I exclaimed, enthused that my
incompetence hadn’t completely taken over. “You had me sit down next to
this homeless guy, so that I’d have someone to talk to while you called a
cab.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to take over from here?” he asked, crossing his arms
and leaning back in his chair. I took a quick swig of my coffee, treating it as
though I were taking shots of gasoline, and continued.</p>
<p>“I remember he told me his name was Rusty and that he wasn’t
really homeless; he just liked the feel of the curb on his ass and the people
who were out late at night. He was really… weird… and old, like 60 or
something,” I said, looking up at the ceiling, trying to decipher the fragments
of memory floating around in my head.</p>
<p><em>“Too hot in there for yah?” Rusty asked, his thick accent, making it
hard to understand what he said.</em></p>
<p><em>“No, my friend wants to leave,” I replied, praying that I wasn’t
talking to a drug-induced hallucination. I looked up and down, back and
forth, enjoying the movement of my neck. Rusty slid closer to me so that we
could hear one another over the traffic/club noise. I didn’t react negatively,
so he took the initiative to continue the conversation. I bit down onto one of
my bangs that had fallen over my face and turned to focus on Rusty’s curly
white beard.</em></p>
<p><em>“Couldn’t he get a date?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think anybody was interested,” I said chewing on my hair
while observing some water, mirroring the above streetlamp, as it trickled
into a gutter.</em></p>
<p><em>“Well I’m sure it’s not his fault… I tell you, I’ve been coming to this
curb for months now, and I’ve never seen a girl leave here with a fella on her
arm. Guess it’s just not a very hot spot for that sort a thing,” Rusty
explained, completely clueless regarding the near by club and its attendants.</em></p>
<p><em>“Guess not,” I said, losing my balance on the wall and starting to
slant to one side. I fluttered my right eyelid while my gaze drifted to the left
with my body. I saw Lillie running back and forth in front of me and I
laughed despite his despair.</em></p>
<p><em>“You fucking asshole! I know you don’t have a fair!” Lillie yelled at
a cab, as he stood in the middle of the street, franticly waving his arms.</em></p>
<p><em>“Why’s a good lookin’ gal like yourself out at a place like this
anyway? Ain’t you married yet?” Rusty asked scratching his gut, which hung
out over the tops of his fully extended legs.</em></p>
<p><em>“No,” I stated frankly, blinking hard to try and keep reality clear.</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s a shame. If someone as attractive as you can’t get married
these days, I don’t know what the worlds comin’ to.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Times change,” I said, regaining my initial leaning position on the
wall.</em></p>
<p><em>“I used to be married, you know? Got married out a high school to
the most beautiful girl alive. We stayed together for years till one day she just
up and disappeared,” he explained, ignoring what I had said and using our
conversation as a means of talking about himself.</em></p>
<p><em>“She left you?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Nah, she died. I don’t know that for sure that is, but I’d like to see
someone at her age get away without so much as a peep,” he explained
casually, not seeming to be disturbed about what he was saying. “See, she
was my teacher and we were havin’ an affair, but after she got pregnant we
had to get married.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Why?” I exclaimed, fixated on a nearby lesbian couple’s franticly
sensual kissing.</em></p>
<p><em>“Cause, we couldn’t have our kid growin’ up to be no bastard; that
sort of thing just wadn’t done back then. These days though, seems
everybody’s a bastard… like it’s the new hip thing to do.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Anyway, we raised that kid up right; up till he moved away and
went to college that is. I was so proud. I don’t think I’d ever been happier in
my life. But, after that, me and the misses didn’t get along all that good; right
up till she died—or disappeared, that is.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Did you ever find out what happened to her?” I asked, stumbling to
my feet as I started to undo my shimmering gold belt, with the oversized,
square, silver, buckle.</em></p>
<p><em>“Someone said they saw her body floatin’ down the river one day,
but they couldn’t catch it before it went over the falls. Do you believe that for
a while they thought I killed her?” he exclaimed, chuckling.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes,” I replied in a monotone voice, quite aware that he was no
longer paying attention to anything I said.</em></p>
<p><em>“I hope they forget the Jaws-of-Life when you get in an accident, you
crazy fuck!” Lillie screamed after jumping away from an oncoming cab.</em></p>
<p><em>“I could never do anything like that though. She was much too heavy
for me to dispose of the corpse right. I don’t think I’ve ever met a woman so
small that weighed so much. But I guess the authorities didn’t see it my way,
and they kept on my case.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s nice,” I mumbled as I finally managed to get my zipper
open. I let my pants go and they slid down neatly to my ankles. I placed both
my hands on the back of my hips and exhaled as I started to piss. Rusty didn’t
seem to notice and kept yammering about his dead wife. The urine trickled
down my leg and a puddle started to leech towards the drain, mixing with the
water, and the reflection of the streetlight.</em></p>
<p><em>“Christ! No wonder we aren’t getting any cabs, Joan!” Lillie cried,
turning to witness me pissing all over myself. I chuckled lightly as I shook off
my imaginary dick. I leaned forward and used the wall for support, resting
my forehead against it.</em></p>
<p><em>“So your name’s Joan then is it?” Rusty asked, looking up at me
romancing the wall.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah,” I replied, bending down for the mutual purpose of mooning
Lillie and pulling up my urine drenched shorts.</em></p>
<p><em>“Nice name, but I think ladies are supposed to crouch when they
pee.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know, but I used to be a man,” I replied, trying to be as clever as
possible while so very, very high. I gave my buckle a quick refastening before
I turned awkwardly to face the street.</em></p>
<p><em>“Joan, get your nasty ass over here!” Lillie screamed, putting his
chest into it and leaning forward. I quickly trotted over to him, as he waited
next to the opened door of a taxi.</em></p>
<p><em>“Nice talkin’ with yah!” I heard Rusty yell as I dove into the cab as
though it were a lake. I managed to sit up, after a few second’s praise for the
fluffy back seat, and waved goodbye to him. Lillie got in a moment later and
told the driver where to go.</em></p>
<p><em>“Sure thing, but what’s that smell?” he asked, curling up his nose
and scowling at us. I bit my bottom lip to try and contain myself but it didn’t
do any good. As I exploded into a crazed laughter, Lillie groaned and
slapped his hands onto his face to conceal the embarrassment. The hilarity of
feeling my urine soak into the interior was too much for him to take, and too
much for me to keep in.</em></p>
<p>“And?” Lillie inquired; raising his eyebrows and giving me a bug
eyed look of anticipation. I fumbled around with the words in my mouth for a
moment, but eventually realized that that was the last thing I remembered.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I forget,” I replied, drinking my coffee, which was
nearly all gone and starting to get thicker towards the bottom.</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, I’ll start from where you left off,” he said, getting off the
edge of his seat and nestling into his chair cushion. “The driver took us home
just in time for you to start puking your guts out. I brought you inside,
pausing occasionally so you could hurl on people’s doormats. When we
actually did get upstairs, I dumped you into your bathtub and tried to hose off
some of the goop. By the way, the shorts you managed to completely drench
in both vomit, and urine, are hanging on the shower faucet,” he said, slowly
crumpling up his cup; making sure I knew he was taking his frustrations for
me out on it.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence following his disposal of yet another one of
my dishes. He glared at me, and I stared into my lap. Eventually I managed
to gather the courage to look up at him and say, “I’m sorry.” Once I said
those words sincerely he stopped clenching his ass and relaxed. His cheeks
started to glow red and he broke eye contact.</p>
<p>“Well as long as you’re ok,” he murmured, rubbing the end of his
foot back and forth on the floor. I watched as a sigh of relief escaped his lips
and he resumed his typical stereotypical drag queen mannerisms absent of
the fury he had tried so hard to convey.</p>
<p>“So, what did we have planned for today?” I asked, the moment
before I slammed down the rest of my coffee. The cup smacked my nose and
the liquid went down, but I felt something, left inside, slide up against my
teeth. I pulled it away from my mouth promptly and gasped. “Fuck Lillie!
There’s a cockroach in this!”</p>
