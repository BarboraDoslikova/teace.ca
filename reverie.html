<p><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p>“I love you, Megan.”</p>
<p>“Lana. My name’s Lana,” she growled, giving out an exasperated hiss
that stung my ears through the receiver.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I’m just over worked,” I explained, staring guiltily at my
empty in-bin.</p>
<p>“No you’re not, Josh,” she stated, letting white noise take the mike.
Ten-Mississippi. “I don’t know who she is, but I pray to shit you can at least get
her name right.”</p>
<p>“Meg—Lana… there isn’t anyone else, I promise you that.”</p>
<p>“That promise is a lie you can keep.”</p>
<p>She hung up before I could speak, before I could explain. The
heartbeat of the now vacant line echoed through my cubicle. Beep… beep…
beep… Fuck. My mouth was open—cow-caught-in-the-headlights style. I put
the phone down and realized I was out. I didn’t see it coming. Somehow I was
under the distinct impression that we were happy. What does that say about
me?</p>
<p>“Mrs. Larrenberg?” I heard a man say in a crisp anal-retentive tone. I
stopped to turn until I’d turned enough to stop. Uncle Sam was at my doorstep.
Two of him, to be exact. Right side: buzz cut, full-out uniform, flag-bearing, all-
American. Wrong side: same as the right.</p>
<p>“Nnnnno,” I replied, squinting to try and deter the intense gaze of GI
Joe.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, we regret to inform you that your husband colonel, Maxwell
Larrenberg was killed last night defending his country.”</p>
<p>“That’s terrible. Oh, wait. I’m not married… and I’m a man.”</p>
<p>“He fought very bravely. We present you with this flag in his honor,”
Right Side stated as Wrong Side approached my desk to lay a freshly ironed
American flag upon my keyboard.</p>
<p>“Guys, I don’t want to have to call security. Mainly because I’ve never
done it before and I don’t care to learn how.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for your loss,” Right Side said comfortingly, before he and
his companion marched out of sight.</p>
<p>I turned to look at the silky flag gracing my office with a variance of
color beyond the customary green post-its. I frowned, letting feeling show—
rare for me, since I was reared under the emotional devastation act of piss-poor
parenting. I wheeled my chair inch-by-inch towards the opening in my cubicle
so I could see down the man-made hallway of my co-workers and catch a final
glimpse of the army putting tax dollars to good use. But they were gone and, as
I swiveled back to face my desk once more, so was the flag.</p>
<p><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p>“I remember being born,” I confessed, gazing into the bland tiles of a
tanned ceiling. The leather upholstery of the couch I lay upon creaked and
moaned. The ticking of an antique grandfather clock reminded me that I was on
the meter and that no revelation or sanctuary was free.</p>
<p>“That’s highly unlikely, Josh… perhaps it was a dream, or maybe
you’ve confused one memory for another,” my shrink told me, agreeable and
sympathetic only so far as to get paid.</p>
<p>“No, this is the real deal,” I muttered, tucking my elbows to my sides
so that I could rest my hands upon my chest. “It was black at first. Quiet. I
don’t know how I was feeling, or anything,” I stated, preempting her incessant
questioning of how I felt. “Then, I remember… opening my eyes… and
hearing… a heartbeat.”</p>
<p>“Whose heart beat?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know… my mother’s… the doctor’s, maybe. But it was loud.
Like the exaggerated pitch you get from one of those machines that registers the
beat as a series of spikes, you know?” I explained, guiding my eyes along the
lines of the room—one connecting to another.</p>
<p>“An ECG?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s it.”</p>
<p>“Then what happened?” she asked, feeding my time into her assertion
that I liked to talk about myself.</p>
<p>“Everyone was staring at me and I didn’t know why,” I detailed, falling
into memory enough to feel a whisper of emotion. “After the black faded,
everything was white and there were lots of people in the room. Some were
wearing hospital jackets, while others were strapped into beds with tubes
running in and out of them. There were large, complex machines all around and
I remember… I tried to move, but they held me down. They stuck a needle in
me and… nothing… that’s all I remember,” I groaned, rubbing my eyes, as a
residual headache crept into my skull.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you tell me what’s really bothering you, Josh,” she said as
encouragingly as she could fake. Clearly, my earliest memories weren’t
interesting enough for her. Shrinks are like magic eight balls; only they’re the
ones asking the questions.</p>
<p>“What’s really bothering me, huh? What’s really bothering me…” I
repeated, using my rambling as a devise to conjure up an answer. “I… fuck, I
don’t know. Lana left me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that. What happened?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking the wrong guy,” I mumbled, pausing, as it was the first
time I’d truly admitted the breakup to anyone, including myself.</p>
<p>“Have you spoken to her about it?”</p>
<p>“I tried. But she’s pretty mad at me… she thinks I’m seeing another
woman.”</p>
<p>“Why does she think that?”</p>
<p>“It’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Pray tell.”</p>
<p>Sigh—not of relief. Putting it into words meant a concrete
understanding of what happened and how I felt. Not bloody likely. I had my
thick crust of denial oozing contempt, gushing regret. Or, at least, that’s how I
thought of it… unfortunately, the capacity to feel was beyond me. But
somehow I knew I’d loved Lana—her smell, her smile. And now my prick of a
therapist was prodding me with her over-inflated ego to try and scare up some
answers. Shoot the messenger, return to sender.</p>
<p>“The court didn’t assign me to you to solve my marital problems,” I
snapped, coughing to clear any sign of irreverence from my tone. She adjusted
herself in her seat—uncomfortable with either what I’d said, or what she’d have
to say. We were both acting here.</p>
<p>“I know perfectly well why you were assigned to me. Just as you know
the consequences of failing to cooperate,” she stated firmly. She didn’t like
me—at all. I leaned my head back to see her sitting down, standing her ground.
I smiled. Mental reminder: two more months with this bitch, and you’re free.</p>
<p>“Fine,” I exclaimed. “But like I said, it’s complicated; so if you keep
butting in with that ‘how do you feel’ crap it’ll take forever.”</p>
<p>“Watch it, Josh.”</p>
<p>“The obvious answer is that, on more than one occasion, at less than
ideal times, I’ve called her Megan.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Megan?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. The only Megan I’ve ever met choked to death half-way
through a pie-eating contest,” I explained, sinking deep into memory to try and
unearth an epiphany. “But that’s not why she left me…” I realized, the fluidity
of my thoughts becoming apparent as I vomited them out.</p>
<p>“Then why did she leave you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know… I’ll have to ask her,” I sighed, sitting up as the clock
chimed-in to set me free. “Not that I wouldn’t love to stay and chat, but I’ve
got misery to tend to,” I said sarcastically, sliding on my coat.</p>
<p>She uncrossed her legs and stood up to show me to the door. She wore
an old grey suit that might have looked nice to anyone with taste. I watched her
unflinching determination to be as professional as she could, while dealing with
someone as utterly intolerable as myself. But I liked to think she was capable of
recognizing that my distaste for her wasn’t personal, it was circumstantial. That,
under my petulant remarks, there was some degree of favor. Who knows? Had
we met any other way, and been completely different people, it might have been
true.</p>
